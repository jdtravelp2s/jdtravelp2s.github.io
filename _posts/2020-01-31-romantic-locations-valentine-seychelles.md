# Seychelles

The island group is situated on the est side of Africa, north of Madagascar and consists of 115 islands. These islands are spread over more than 200 km of sea.

## Mahé

Landing on Mahé after a long flight you probably don't want to take a boat or another plane right away. So why not stay o Mahé for a while? There is plenty to do on the main island, take a car-tour around the land and halt at ever romantic spot you'll find, rent a bike and cycle to the nearest beaches to relax or take a walk into the national park which covers 20% of Mahés land, to reach the highest peak of the seychelles _Morne Seychellois_ standing at 905m. Being on top gives you a imparable view of Mahé and the sea surrounding the island.

## Bird Island

If you feel ready to take a short flight with an amazing view, then you are ready for Bird Island. Besides being the home of many bird species and turtles it hosts one of the most fauna and flora of the Seychelles. Being a small island, you can cicle around by foot while wetting your feet in the sea.

## Fregate Island

This island is located 55 km away from Mahé. Its microcosm flourishes and is the home of the andemic magpie robin bird along with forty different bird species. If you are in search of comfort, look no further! Fregate Island has lururious five star lodges which are visited by some hollywood stars each year.

## La Digue

Of course, you can't end your trip without setting foot on La Digue. A location where time stood still and the only vehicules are bicycles and carts. If you can, I highly recommend renting a bicycle and ride around the island to visit the traditional architecture and breathtaking beaches. La Digue is also the best place to take a boat tour for snorkeling and diving activities.
