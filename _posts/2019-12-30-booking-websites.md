It can be challenging to find the best deal when it comes to planing your trip. I struggled a lot finding the lowest price or the best price/value ratio for a lot of trips in past. 

<!--more-->

Usually I started googling in search of hotels in the city I wanted to visit, then picking the one I liked the most (or the ones I could afford), and then began the real struggle: finding the lowest price for a particular hotel. There are a ton of booking websites! There is booking.com, trivago, hotel.com... you can search all day before you're 100% sure you booked at the lowest price! Even the site comparing prices don't always have the same results!

# Let's book a hotel

So it begs a question, why don't we compare on our own and see what is consistently the cheapest?
So let's say we want to travel to Paris, Venice and Los Angeles. We will compare prices on [booking.com](https://www.booking.com), [hotels.com](https://www.hotels.com/), [trivago](https://www.trivago.com/) and finally I'll check what prices I can get on p2s travel for partners. All tests are in the same time periode of one week from the 30th of august till the 7th of september 2020, for two.

# Paris

In Paris we'll look at a room in the Villa Luxembourg Hotel.

1. booking.com

Booking.com listed the Villa Luxembourg at 1375 € (1537 $) for seven nights for two breakfast included.

2. hotels.com

Hotels.com listed it at 1429 € (1596 $) again, this price is for seven nights breakfast included.

3. trivago.com

On trivago the price stood at 698 € (779 $) which is alot cheaper than the first two sites tested.

4. P2S Travel

On P2S Travel we find the same for 680 € (760 $) which is close under trivagos price.

# Paris conclusion

For Paris I would recommend trivago if you don't want to be a P2S Travel partner. Trivago offers a very competitive price compared to booking and hotels.com which really suprised me! Remember that as a P2S partner you'll only pay 340 € (380 $) for this trip. See how this is possible [here!](https://jdtravel.github.io) [Or here!](https://p2stravel.com/jdtravelp2s)


# Venice

Here we observe the price differences from a room in the Relai Ca' Sabbioni hotel.

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/venice.jpeg" alt="hotel venice">

1. booking.com

Booking.com listed the Relai Ca' Sabbioni at 778 € (870 $) for seven nights for two breakfast included. 

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/venice-booking.png" alt="booking hotel venice">

2. hotels.com

Hotels.com listed it at 759 € (848 $) price includes breakfast as well.

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/venice-hotels.png" alt="hotels venice">

3. trivago.com

From trivago the price didn't drop as low as I expected and stayed a little below hotels.com at 690 € (771 $).

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/Venice-trivago.png" alt="trivago hotel venice">

4. P2S Travel

On P2S Travel I could find the same for 655 € (732 $) which again is underbidding trivago by a small margin.

# Venice conlusion

Same as for Paris I would recommend trivago if you're not consider becoming a P2S Travel partner.


# Los Angeles

In Los Angeles we'll look at the Westin Pasadena.

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/LA.jpg" alt="hotel Los Angeles">

1. booking.com

Booking.com listed the room at 1626 € (1817 $) breakfast included. 

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/LA-booking.png" alt="booking hotel Los Angeles">

2. hotels.com

Hotels.com presented the room at a price of 1772 € (1980 $) including breakfast as well.

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/LA-hotels.png" alt="hotels Los Angeles">

3. trivago.com

From trivago we got 1538 € (1718 $) which is not as cheap as we're used to from trivago.

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/LA-trivago.png" alt="trivago hotel Los Angeles">

4. P2S Travel

On P2S Travel I could find the same for 1051 € (1174 $)! This is alot cheaper. 

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/booking-website/LA-p2s.png" alt="p2s travel hotel Los Angeles">

# Los Angeles conclusion

On this one I really can't recommend anything else than becoming a P2S Travel partner. Remember you're just paying half of it due to your invested money being doubled into travel dollars, so you only pay 525.50 € (587 $)!
