# Florence

A city with history, character and Italian charm. Florence is a place filled with marvelous art and incredible monuments that have hardly changed since the Renaissance.

## Bring a flower to Beatrice

As a child the famous poet Dante Alighieri fell in love with Beatrice. While they never ended up as a couple, Dante's passion inspired him the "Divine Comedy". In the church of Santa Margherita dei Cerchi there is a plaque acting as a memorial for Beatrice. Bringing a flower or making a wish in front oh this plaque became a tradition for lovers from all over the world.

## Villa Bardini Garden

Less crowded than the Boboli Garden, the Bardini Garden is set on a hill side in the Oltrarno. The garden shines with beauty in spring and summertime but if you're lucky, and it doesn't rain, it is worth a look for it's acient stairs and statues, even in february.

## Piazza Signoria

During daylight this place is beautiful and a bit crowded but at night it really shines. There are ancient buildings and statues where ever you look. This is fantastic for a romantic moment with your lover!
