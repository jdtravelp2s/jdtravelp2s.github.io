# Marrakech

We're starting this list with a city that might not come to mind when you think of a romantic place. This is far from the truth, Marrakech with it's oriental charm and wonderful landscape, easily qualifies as romantic! Marrakech is a beautiful city to visit as a couple, you could see a lot of breathtaking sigths just by roaming around (be careful though, you don't want to get lost!). Of course, for valentine's Day it should be extra special. This means you'll want to plan ahead. That's why I picked a few beautiful places you could visit with your loved one while on a romantic week-end.

## El Badi Palace

This palace in ruins dating from the 16th century is once said to be the most beautiful palace in the world. A few centuries back it had more than 350 rooms, all decorated with gold and Italian decorations. Some of these rooms have been renovated and can be visited for those who want totake a look at the opulence of Marocco from the 1500s.

## Menera Gardens

Situated in the desert, these gardens where handmade in the 12th century thanks to an irregation system. Perfectly suited for romantic walks they provide a pleasant amount of shade contrasting the heat emitted by the surroundings.

## Ouzoud Falls

If you prefer nature made sights you'll have to drive a bit out of Marrakech to the Ouzoud Falls. There you'll encounter multiple waterfalls which rushes down from a 110 meters (360 ft) height. The falls are also known for it's wild life sightings. Actracted by the water you'll probably see a few wild monkeys.

## Camel ride

This list wouldn't be complete without the iconic camel ride through the desert. There are many places to book a camel ride, on occasions as low as 20 to 30 â‚¬ (23 to 33 $) a trip. Most of them will include a meal or two depending on the duration of the ride. You can even book a two or three day ride to appreciate the sunset over the dunes and sleeping in tents, close to your soulmate, during freezing nights.
