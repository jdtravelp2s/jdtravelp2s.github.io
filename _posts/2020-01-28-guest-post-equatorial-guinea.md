# Have you ever heard of Equatorial Guinea?

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/guest-post/Equatorial-Guinea/03.jpg" alt="Equatorial Guinea">

Being the only Spanish-speaking country on the African continent, it is a unique land south of Cameron in central Africa. Until recently, its economy was exclusively based on oil and its derivatives. But recently, it has begun to open the doors to tourism. That puts Equatorial Guinea in a wonderful position for all nature-loving tourists and pioneers looking for unique adventures.

# Equatorial Guinea is sea

They are the islands of Bioko, Annobon and Corisco. Their incredible landscape blends lush natural forests with unspoiled and unexplored beaches. In Equatorial Guinea you can discover how nature is beautiful and how it does not need man to provide dreamlike passages.

# Urekas waterfalls 

The falls reach more than 200 meters in height leading to the sea. The new city of Sipopo and its private beach that takes you to the Islet of Horacio, source of magical myths. The coves of love in Annobon, where falling in love becomes a tradition. The crystalline and white waters of Corisco, where the destination is not the most important but the path.

# Equatorial Guinea is forest

It is the continental part, in Ebibeying, Mongomo, Mount Allen. It is to feel the immensity and power of the forest, which absorbs and dictates people’s lives. It is work and sacrifice to obtain from nature what we need, always appreciating and pampering it as it deserves. It is fauna and it is flora. They are giant endangered turtles spawning on the beach. It is the ceiba, a century-old tree embedded in our flag.

# Equatorial Guinea are mountains 

It is the Basilé peak, it is Moka, it is those impressive lakes and landscapes that are found in the craters of ancient volcanoes. They are walks through the woods to natural viewpoints where you feel the king of the jungle.
Equatorial Guinea is culture. Its tribes Fangs, Bubis, Ndowés, Annoboneses, Bisios…they are kind, open and charming people. It is an endless of rites and traditions, which together form a unique landscape. It is coexistence, admiration, respect and tolerance for others.
