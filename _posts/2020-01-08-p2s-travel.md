# What is P2S Travel?

As talked about [here](https://jdtravelp2s.github.io/), P2S Travel is a private travel club which aims at getting the best prices for hotels, boat cruises, vacation activities, car renting and more. Instead of spending money on ads like other booking sites, P2S Travel offers you the chance of not only travelling, but also earning a salary by becoming a partner!

# P2S Travel partner

P2S Travel offers two partner subscriptions, the titanium and the platinium partnership. Additionnally to getting access to the P2S Travel reservation website, partners are offered a free trip for there subscription (location depends on your location) and an advantageous travelling saving system.

# Titanium Partner

Becoming a titanium partner costs *129.95$ the first month and 69.95$/month every following month*. With this you'll get all partner privileges, which are getting access to P2S Travel reservation website, your free entry trip, every monthly fee will be **doubled** in travel points (see *travel points* below) and you'll get access to so called **Dreamcations** (see *dreamcations* below). 

# Platinium Partner

For you to become a platinium partner costs *249.95$ the first month and 129.95$/month every following month*. Again, you will have access to the P2S Travel reservation website, your free entry trip, every monthly fee will be **doubled** in travel points and you'll get access to **Dreamcations**. Read on to see why Platinium is more expensive than Titanium and why it's the number one seller.

# Travel Points

Your monthly subscription fee is automatically converted in travel points each month. Each dollar you invest is worth two travel points, when you'll use your travel points to buy a trip each travvel point will be worth 1 dollar. For example if you pay *69.95$* a month, then *69.95$* are converted to *139.90 travel points* which are worth *139.90$*!

# Dreamcations

Dreamcations are exclusive stays in hotel, villas, resorts and more for P2S Travel partners. There are more than **4000 stays** all over the globe which can accomodate for 2 to 10 people! 

As a Titanium partner you can attend a dreamcation by buying up to 75% of the price with travel points. For example, if the stay costs 1000$ then as a Titanium partner you'll have to pay at least 250$ without travel points.

As a Platinium partner you'll be able to buy with up to 100% of the price with travel points!

# The remuneration plan

With 3 personally sponsored Platinium members, you earn $ 50 fast start bonus + $ 100 leadership bonus, or $ 150 (€ 134),from that moment you earn a daily residual income and most importantly **your monthly subscription fee is payed for!**

Your first two partners are coded to your sponsor. In the same way, the first two partners of all your direct partners (from the 3rd) will be coded to you. You win $ 100 (€ 89) on the first two sponsors and all your direct partners to infinity. And that’s not all .. the first two partners of your partners will sponsor in turn and you will pocket $ 100 on each of their first two sponsorships .. and same thing if these “first two” sponsor in turn.

Additionally, your daily income increases the bigger your team gets!
