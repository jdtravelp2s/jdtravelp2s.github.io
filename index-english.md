# If time and money were not an issue, what would you do?

How often do you travel each year? Do you want to travel more? What is holding you back from traveling?

# Welcome to P2S Travel

P2S Travel makes travel accessible to everyone!

P2S Travel was founded by David Hart in 2013 and is now represented in over 100 countries. As a private travel club, P2S Travel offers the best prices and the best compensation options worldwide.

# How is that possible?

You have probably been to some travel portals, each of which promises the best prices, but none of these portals can compete with P2S Travel. The reason is advertising, all travel portals make commercials, posters, website banners, etc. This advertising costs and has a direct impact on customer bookings. P2S Travel does not advertise, so it does not pay for it, which results in significantly better prices. P2S Travel is made known by its members. Since a lot of value is placed on the wellbeing of our members, they are paid to spread the word about our travel club. More on that later.

# To join

If you want to forego member benefits and still want to travel at the best prices, you can [register here for free](https://thehotelsite.com/jdp2stravel). There are no costs when you register, you only pay when you book a hotel at the best prices. In addition, by recommending this page, you can earn money for your future hotel stays and win free trips!

# Join as a customer

## basic customer

As a customer, join if you are only interested in traveling. This gives you access to the P2S Travel Portal, where you can not only book hotels, but also flights, car rentals, boat trips, holiday activities and much more.

Membership costs € 72 in the first month and € 36 in the following months. These costs are not lost! Everything you pay as a member will be converted into travel points. You can use these travel points immediately or wait a month
so that they are doubled. If you pay € 72 in the first month, this corresponds to 79 travel points (points are counted in dollars) in the first month. In the second month you pay € 36 ($ 39), get 39 travel points and now have 197 points. These points can be used at any time.

## Titan customer

Becoming a Titan partner costs € 115 the first month and € 62 / month after the first month. This gives you all partner privileges: access to the P2S Travel reservation website, a free trip, every monthly fee is converted into travel points and you get access to so-called "I-Trips" and "We-Trips". More on that below.

## Platinium customer

If you become a Platinium partner, this will cost € 225 the first month and € 115 / month after the first month. Again, you have access to the P2S Travel reservation website, a free trip, every monthly fee is converted into travel points and you get access to so-called "I-Trips" and "We-Trips".

# Join as a partner

## business partner

If you are not interested in travel and discounts, you can still join as a business partner for € 50 a year. This only grants you access to the direct sales bonus, i.e. € 12.50 per basic customer, € 25 per Titanium customer and € 50 per Platinium customer.

In addition, you can benefit from the compensation plan if you are also a customer and thus earn a monthly salary. Every person who joins as a customer with your code P2S Travel brings you a direct bonus. The bigger your team gets, the higher your monthly salary will be.

## Volume

Your team volume differs by partner type. Every Basic customer brings you 25, Titan-Partner 45 and Platinum 80 volume points. Business partners do not score points.

# "I-trips"

"I-Trips" are exclusive stays in hotels, villas, resorts and much more for P2S Travel Partners. There are more than 4000 stays all around the world that can accommodate from 2 to 10 people!

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/FrontPage/I-trip.png" alt="p2s travel I-trip dreamcations">

As a Titan partner, you can participate in a dream trip by buying up to 75% of the price with travel points. For example, if the stay costs € 1000, as a Titan partner you have to pay at least € 250 without travel points.

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/FrontPage/India.jpg" alt="p2s travel I-trip dreamcations Titan Partner">

As a Platinium partner, you can buy up to 100% of the price with travel points! You can go on vacation for free!

# "We-Trips"

"We-Trips" are group trips with P2S travel partners from all over the world. These are pre-reduced in price and can be reduced even further by using travel points. The following also applies here: As a Platinium partner, you receive better discounts than a Titan partner.

# Frequently asked Questions

## Can I earn money as a customer?

No, you can only earn money as a partner. If you are already a customer, you can register as a partner for € 50, which gives you direct access to the compensation plan.

## Is the remuneration for basic partners the same as for Platinium partners?

Yes, the remuneration is exactly the same as soon as you are partner and customer.

## How many clients do I need to get a salary?

This varies depending on the type of customer because your content depends on your volume. To become 1 Star Director you need 48 basic customers or 27 Titanium customers or 15 Platinium customers. Of course, you can also have a mixture of the three.

## How is my payment paid out?

As soon as you have brought in two customers, a credit card will be sent to you by post, so it is important to provide your address correctly. You can use this card like an ordinary credit card.
