# Travel and save the world!

<img class="d-block w-100 img-fluid" src="/assets/icons/Logo01.png" alt="eco plane ticket">

Day dreaming about travelling the world, relaxing on beaches with cristal clear water, feeling the freezing air of mountains with the whitest of snow, exploring historical cities you've only read about in books. You open your eyes and reality hits you *'I can't afford such trips!'*. But a comforting though lingers in your mind **_'I'm doing my part for the environment, if I don't travel I'm not releasing as much carbon dioxyde.'_**

**Don't you want to live your dreams while caring for the world?**

You can achieve all your travel dreams and more if you read a little further!

# How can you do both?

A little while ago I joined P2S Travel, a company which primary goal is to make travelling affordable for everyone by providing discounts on hotel stays, boat cruises, car renting and more. Additionally it garanties a very good salary to those who are willing to enroll as partners and encourage others to do the same. Which is absolutely awesome! But wait! What about saving the world? If you travel more you're releasing more carbon dioxyde which contributes to global warming, that doesn't look good for humanity's future!

# The 'travel to plant trees' program

On top of all advantages P2S Travel offers, **10 trees** will be planted if you join as titanium member and **20 trees** if you join as a platinum member [join here](https://p2stravel.com/join/jdtravelp2s/). After you've subscribed **one tree** will be planted every month thanks to you.
