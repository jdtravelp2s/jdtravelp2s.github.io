# Do you have a dream?

Do you dream of a vacation on tropical Islands?

Or a city sightseeing tour?

Or a trip on snowy mountains?

All of this while getting a five figure salary and staying in a 5 star hotel? But how you may ask... well, Welcome to P2S Travel!

# What is P2S Travel?

P2S Travel is a company which goal is to make travelling affordable for everyone by proposing discounts for hotel stays, boat cruises, flights, car renting and more! These discounts are at least 10 to 15% under the lowest prices you can find on other sites. But who am I to be trusted? Just check it out for yourself! Feel free to compare prices with your favourite website.

# That's it?

Of course not, far from it! Earlier I wrote about a five figure salary and travelling to dream locations, but what do you have to do to get these? If you're asking this question then you'll might be interested in the P2S travel partner program. 

# The P2S Travel Partner Program

The partner program is simple: 

1. You register

2. You get others to register as you did

3. You get paid

Now, it is a bit more complex than that of course, but if you read on you'll be ready to start off in no time!

There are two types of partner registration: one is the titanium membership and the ohter is the platinum membership.

The titanium membership cost 129.95$ one-time fee and the platinum cost 249.95$ one-time fee. This will get you going for the first month and if you play your cards right you wont have to pay the monthly fee at all, you'll even get paid as  I promised.
