# Do you have a dream?

Do you dream of a vacation on tropical Islands?

Or a city sightseeing tour?

Or a trip on snowy mountains?

All of this while getting a five figure salary and staying in a 5 star hotel without having to work 40+ hours a week? But how you may ask... well, Welcome to P2S Travel!

# What is P2S Travel?

P2S Travel is a company which goal is to make travelling affordable for everyone by proposing discounts for hotel stays, boat cruises, flights, car renting and more! These discounts are at least 10 to 15% under the lowest prices you can find on other sites. But who am I to be trusted? Just check it out for yourself! Feel free to compare prices with your favourite website.

# That's it?

Of course not, far from it! Earlier I wrote about a five figure salary and travelling to dream locations, but what do you have to do to get these? If you're asking this question then you'll might be interested in the P2S travel partner program. 

# The P2S Travel Partner Program

Let's go over all you'll get from your registration. As a partner you get access to so called dreamcations, these are hotel stays you can even get for free! 

How does it work? As a partner every dollar you invest P2S Travel doubles and given to you as travel points.

There are two types of partner registration: one is the titanium membership and the ohter is the platinum membership.

The titanium membership cost 129.95$ one-time fee (this includes your first month) and 69.95$ monthly and the platinum membership cost 249.95$ one-time fee (same as titanium, your first month is included in this one-time fee) and 125$ monthly.

# So I do have to pay for this?

I know, I told you you'll get paid and now you have to pay? But wait, there's more to the patnership than the monthly fee. You  can convince people to join P2S Travel as members of your team, you'll get paid for every member you enroll and you'll get paid again for every member your team enrolls and there team and so on! Even better, you'll get a monthly salary depending on how many members your team has! Your monthly is automatically paid for as soon as your team reaches two members! And, don't forget the travel points I talked about earlier, the monthly fee is converted in travel points even if you don't pay for it yourself!

[Here all in great detail](http://global.paid2save.com/include/compplan.pdf). It's not easy at first, but if read all of it carefully I'm sure you'll understand how P2S works. Feel free to write me an email and ask any questions you want! (write #p2s in the object field to make sure your email doesn't end up in my spam folder).
